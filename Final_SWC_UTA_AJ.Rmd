This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r, echo=FALSE}
gap.in <-read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", 
                    sep = "\t", 
                    header= TRUE)
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
gap.in %>%
  filter(country == "Bahrain") %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) -> data1 
  plot(data1$year, data1$gdpPercap, xlab= "Year", ylab= "GDP/cap", main= "GDP/year Bahrain")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gap.in %>%
  filter(country == "Djibouti") %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) -> data2
  plot(data2$year, data2$gdpPercap, xlab= "Year", ylab= "GDP/cap", main= "GDP/year Djibouti")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gap.in %>%
  filter(country == "Spain") %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) -> data3
  plot(data3$year, data3$gdpPercap, xlab= "Year", ylab= "GDP/cap", main= "GDP/year Spain")

```

Over the past 60 years, Bahrain and Spain have experienced an increase in GDP/year, while the GDP/year of Djibouti has decreased.



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
