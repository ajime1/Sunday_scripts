# Pick three countries you are interested in. Write an Rmd script to load the data file, 
#select all the data for that country, and make three scatter plots (one for each country) 
# that have year on the x-axis and GDP on the y axis. Make sure you load all the libraries 
# you might need (dplyr, etc). Describe any trends you see for each country using markdown text.
#Commit your changes using git. You can do this from the command line or in RStudio if you like.
